Devcenter Reactjs Test
==================================

The technical test consists of a coding test and a few follow-up questions.  It is not intended that applicants spend a great deal of time on the project - no more than four hours.

How to complete the task
==================================

1. Fork this repository into your own public repo.

2. Upload two folders to your repo. One with all the code required to run you solution and the other with the answers to the questions as a PDF.

3. Complete the project and commit your work. Send the URL of your own repository to @seun on the Slack here bit.ly/dcs-slack.

4. If you are not comfortable with using Git, you can download the source files as a ZIP archive (click the Download ZIP button on the right). Complete the task and then re-archive all of your files. Share the file @seun on the Slack here bit.ly/dcs-slack using a service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.



## Code Test

We need a simple two page website to display the current Lagos Weather using the Open Weather API (http://openweathermap.org/api).  One page will be called 'Weather' and the other page called 'Sunrise/set'.

### Inputs

- Units
  - Imperial or Metric

### Output

- Weather Page
  - Current Date/Time
  - Current Temperature in selected unit
  - Current Weather Description
  - Current Wind Speed in selected unit
- Sunrise/set Page
  - Current Date/Time
  - Sunrise Time
  - Sunset Time

### Technical Requirements

- Requirements
  - React (http://facebook.github.io/react/)
  - Open Weather API (http://openweathermap.org/api)
  - Runs on modern browsers with no browser plugins required
- Flexibility On
  - Use of Flux (https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content) 
  - Look/Feel
  - Browser Compatibilty
  - Libraries Used
  - User Interface
  - Language e.g. Javascript / Typescript / etc
  - Pretty much everything else!

### Level of Finish/Timescales

- Prototype
  - It doesn’t need to be complete, just demonstrate the concepts
- Approximate Timescale
  - It should be possible to rough up a prototype in 4 hours if everything goes smoothly, don’t worry about spending ages on it but let me know how long you spent.
  - Feel free to drop areas of functionality if they are a significant time drain, the aim is a prototype not a finished product

## Follow Up Questions

1. How long did you spend on the code test?
2. What went well?
3. Was there anything that was attempted but was not possible to get working in the time so is not visible in the code?
4. What would you do to improve it / continue development?
